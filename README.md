# 🏦 Loan Approval Prediction App

This is a mini machine learning project where I built a web-based application using **Python**, **scikit-learn**, and **Flask** to predict loan approvals based on applicant details.

## 🚀 Project Overview

The goal is to predict whether a loan will be approved or not based on inputs like income, credit history, education, and more. I trained and compared five classification models and deployed the best-performing one using a Flask web interface.

### 🔍 Models Trained
- Logistic Regression ✅ *(Best: ~80.7% accuracy)*
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Support Vector Classifier (SVC)

### 📊 Key Feature Inputs
- Gender (0 = Female, 1 = Male)
- Married (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
- Dependents (0, 1, 2, 3+)
- Education (0 = Not Graduate, 1 = Graduate)
- Self Employed (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
- Applicant Income
- Coapplicant Income
- Loan Amount
- Loan Term
- Credit History (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
- Property Area (0 = Rural, 1 = Semiurban, 2 = Urban)

## 💻 Tech Stack
- Python 3.x
